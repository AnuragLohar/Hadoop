Kerberos Encryption

Two things in Encryption 
1. Encryption in Motion : SSL/TLS
2. Encryption at Rest : Enable encryption zones. Rest data any one can see.

We need keys to perform encryption.
1. Java Based Key Store (Key Management Service (KMS) )
2. Cloudera Navigater (Key Trustee Server (KTS) )

Encryption

Cloudera

- Click on down arrow beside cluster name
-  Add Service
- Java Key Store (KMS)
- Continue
- Select Host (Cloudera Utensils)
- Continue
Setup Access Control List
- kms
- kms

Cloudera says
- Never enter hdfs in the ACL as user

- Continue
- Continue
- Continue
- Finish

Q> How to add services to secured cluster or prerequisites
Ans: On cloudera Manager we just have to add services.
If its not cloudera then we have to create service principal of those services in KDC.
 
- HDFS
- Restart
- Restart Sales Service
- Finish

We need to create principal for KMC user
that we added in ACL

Terminal

- Connect to CM where KDC is running
- ssh -i prati.pem ubuntu@ip

- sudo kadmin.local
- addprinc kms
- pwd
- pwd
- Exit

- Connect to worker node
- ssh -i prati.pem ubuntu@ip
- kinit -p user1
- hadoop key list
Shows: Cannot list keys for KeyProvider:

- hadoop key create mykey
Shows: mykey has not been created. org.apache.hadoop.security.authorize.AuthorizationException: User:user1 not allowed to do 'CREATE_KEY' on 'mykey'
- kdestroy

- su hdfs
- cd
- kinit -p hdfs
- pwd
- hadoop key list
Shows: Cannot list keys for KeyProvider

- hadoop key create mykey
Shows : mykey has not been created. org.apache.hadoop.security.authorize.AuthorizationException: User:user1 not allowed to do 'CREATE_KEY' on 'mykey'
- exit

Create the key 
- sudo passwd kms
- kms
- kms
- su kms
- cd
- kinit -p kms
- hadoop key list
Shows: Listing keys for KeyProvider: KMSClientProvider[http://ip-172-31-62-251.ec2.internal:16000/kms/v1/]
- hadoop key create mykey
Shows: mykey has been successfully created
- hadoop key list
Shows key

Create encrypted zone
Two scenarios will be their
1. Make already present directory zone
2. Create dedicated directory zone 

- exit (kms)
- su hdfs
- hdfs dfs -mkdir /zone1
- hdfs crypto -createZone -keyName mykey -path /zone1
Shows: added encryption zone /zone1

Key will be created by the user who wants to create zone
but the zone will be created by hdfs


- hdfs dfs -ls /
To check ownership is on hdfssuper group
Shows: drwxr-xr-x   - hdfs supergroup          0 2020-08-31 10:01 /zone1
- hdfs dfs -chown kms:kms /zone1
- hdfs dfs -ls /
Shows : drwxr-xr-x   - kms  kms                 0 2020-08-31 10:01 /zone1
ownership changed

try to write from hdfs to zone1
- nano abc
- write something
It will show a error message
- hdfs dfs -put abc /zone1
It will show a error message

No permission for read and write in zone
- exit

Put data in encrypted zone
- su kms
- pwd
- klist
- nano xyz
- write data
- hdfs dfs -put xyz /zone1
It is able to write
- hdfs dfs -cat /zone1/xyz
abs
sk
- exit

Try accessing from other user
- su hdfs
- pwd
- cd
- hdfs dfs -cat /zone1/xyz
Not allowed

You have successfully encrypted data. Even root user can not be able to see it.
